# Matrix Game
This is a C programming project we had to do in the '2023 November - Version 1A' past paper of 'IT1010 - Introduction to Programming' module of SLIIT. I tried doing the question in a functional programing approach
to derive the solution. The following is the description of the project.

You are supposed to write a C program to implement an obstacle game where you have an object to move from one location to another by avoiding obstacles. 
Obstacles are represented using 1s and other areas by 0s. Follow the steps given below.

a) Declare a 2D integer array called maze of size 5 by 5.
b) Allow the user to place 5 obstacles and set those to ls. Every time a new obstacle is placed, make sure you have not placed the obstacle in the same location previously.

Enter the location of obstacle 1 : 2 3
Enter the location of obstacle 2 : 4 2
Enter the location of obstacle 3 : 2 3
Sorry, there is an obstacle in this place.

c) Fill the other array elements with Os.
d) Display the array to the user as shown below.
e) Ask the user to input the start location of the object in the maze and find and display the directions it can move without obstacles. 
Consider only up, down, left and right cells. The start location can't be an obstacle.

Enter your current location in the maze: 2 2
You can move up, left and down.
